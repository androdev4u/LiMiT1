# LiMiT1

Software to turn a Raspberry Pi 3 (preferred) or 2 into a Wifi based Man-In-The-Middle device.

Includes everything needed to setup a Raspberry for such a task, control it via web interface, collect data from attached devices and analyze them subsequently.

Up to now, almost everything is in **German** language only (see [LIESMICH.md](./LIESMICH.md)).

I18N is on my agenda, albeit not topmost.
